ASCII -> Morse:
	A simple (ASCII) text to morse converter.

Usage:
	Run without arguments and you'll be taken to a prompt that will convert stdin
	Run with an argument (e.g. ./t2m input_file) and it will read input_file
	and then spit out the original ASCII text and it's morse code counterpart.

	Each morse code letter is separated by a space for legibility, and each word is separated
	with a double space.

Building:
	Just run Make

Limitations:
	Won't handle unicode characters, probably fail spectacularly if you try.

All code is GPLv3.
