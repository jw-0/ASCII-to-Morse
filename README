Text to Morse:
	A simple (ASCII) text to morse converter.

Usage:
	Run without arguments and you'll be taken to a prompt that will convert stdin
	Run with an argument and it will try and read in the file and it will spit out
	the contents of that file both raw and converted to stdout.

Building:
	Just run Make

Limitations:
	Won't handle unicode characters, probably fail spectacularly if you try.

All code is GPLv3.
